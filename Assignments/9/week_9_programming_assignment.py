COMP 3006
Homework 9 - Numpy

General Homework Guidelines:
- Homework must be submitted in a .py file. Please do not submit .ipynb files.
- Homework should not use packages or functions that have not yet been discussed in class.
- Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
- Use a consistent coding style.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Test your code regularly using a variety of different inputs.
- Every function must include a docstring for documentation (see:
   https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/). This docstring should include:
     - 1 or 2 lines describing what the function does
     - Args: input parameters, their types and what they are for
     - Returns: return data type and what it is
- All tests of your functions should be commented out in your final submission or
  encolosed with an if __name__ == '__main__' codeblock.
- All functions should use return statements to return a value, rather than
  printing some value, unless the instructions specifically say to print.

#Assignment 9.1
# Create a class, called Distributions, that has the following attributes : distribution, mean, standard deviation and size.
# It should have a constructor, __str__ and the ability to generate a normal distribution, lognormal and laplace distributions
# based on the distribution attribute.
# For example:
# my_distribution = Distributions(dist="lognormal", mean=1, std=5, samples=100)
# should be a lognormal distribution with a mean of 1, standard deviation of 5 and have 100 samples from the distribution

# Assignment 9.2:
# Repeat the first part, this time calling the class NumpyDistribution, using only numpy methods
# Hint: https://numpy.org/doc/1.22/, you may want to looks at using args and kwargs

# Assignment 9.3:
# Use only methods from numpy and matplotlib.
# Display the plot of one period of both the cosine and sine. They should appear on the same axes. Label the axes and the plot. Provide a grid.
# Display the plot of one period of both the cosine and sine. They should appear on the different axes but share the y-axis. Label the axes and the plot. Provide a grid.
# Display the plot of one period of both the cosine and sine. They should appear on the different axes but share the x-axis. Label the axes and the plot. Provide a grid.

# Assignment 9.4:
# In a separate file, test_homework9.py, write the necessary unittests for questions 9.1 and 9.2. Take careful consideration to
# test valid and invalid values for the creation of any of the distributions.
